 there lived a man who was known for his generosity and kindness. He had a heart of gold and a mind that was always thinking of others. One day, he met a young girl who was struggling to make ends meet. She was a hard worker, but her income was not enough to cover her basic needs. The man felt sorry for her and decided to do something about it. He went to the bank and opened a savings account for her, promising to deposit money every month. He also gave her some advice on how to save and invest wisely. The young girl was overjoyed at the thought of having a secure future. She promised to take care of the account and use the money only for good causes. Soon, the man's generosity spread like wildfire. People started to notice his kindness and started to ask for help. He opened accounts for them too, and they all promised to repay him with interest. The man's heart was filled with joy and gratitude. He knew that he was doing the right thing, and he felt blessed to be able to help others. As time passed, the man's generosity grew even more. He opened more accounts and gave more advice to those who asked for it. He became a beacon of hope and inspiration to many. The young

 there was a king... well, actually, I shouldn't refer to him as a king - he was never actually crowned. He looked at everything that went on around across Spain.

 a treasure map was found. The map features an ancient treasure at a special location that remains unknown. However, the map shows a series of clues that can lead to the treasure's location.

The map consists of a grid with $H=5$ rows and $W=10$ columns, denoted as $C$. Some cells in $C$ are marked as being relevant to the treasure hunt. These cells are all marked at coordinates $(T, j_i)$, where $T=1$ indicates the treasure is at the first row, and $j_i$ is the column number of that relevant cell.

The cell at $(T, N)$, regardless of its content, is marked as "NOT$C$".

The treasure hunt is organized by saying: "Go to the cell marked $(1, i)$, which is related to the treasure, perform a certain operation on the cell around it and repeat this process until you find the hidden treasure".

The special operation to be performed on the cell marked $(1, i)$ is: If the cell's content is "Cookie", mark all $N$ cells next to the cell marked $(1, i)$ as "NOT$C$" and replace the content of each of them with the value $-

 there was a Mermaid Dragon named Serine that lived in the lazy stream. She was patient, gentle and kind. Many animals lived by the stream, and all of them enjoyed the cool water and beautiful scenery of their little kingdom. In this kingdom lives a Butcher Bear called Loki. Loki is a friendly fall-guy who loves entertaining people. Sometimes he pulls little pranks and other comical stunts. And others, he is rather disastrous, as when he accidentally broke Fred Flinstone's fist in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit".
Loki has three simple goals in
life that are to follow: 1) eat, 2) work in his little chocolate factory, which he describes as: "fairzing easy chocolate", 3) and 4) train, practice, and do all the creative, amazing, cool things that poke for fun at people's disbelief. He is a doer, and he loves to see people change their thinking about something to have fun. It is often very evident in Loki's dreams, but always not very obvious. Often home-made Ikea furniture becomes the main cast of his dreams, or sometimes some aspiring artists meet and do an improv show of some sort.
Loki dreams about "Danvers"

 there was a magical kingdom where people lived happily ever after. This kingdom was known as the Land of the Rising Sun, and it was ruled by a benevolent emperor.
One day, a band of evil sorcerers from a neighboring kingdom decided to attack the Land of the Rising Sun. They knew that the emperor was a powerful wizard and could protect his people from harm. However, the sorcerers also knew that the emperor had a weakness: he was addicted to a powerful magic potion that he used to keep himself young and strong.
The sorcerers decided to use this weakness against the emperor. They created a magical potion that would turn the emperor into a mere mortal, and they sent their best sorcerer to the Land of the Rising Sun to administer the potion.
The sorcerer arrived at the emperor’s palace and presented himself as a humble servant. He told the emperor that he had come to offer his services as a personal assistant. The emperor, who was always eager to please, agreed to let the sorcerer stay in his palace.
The sorcerer began to work for the emperor, and soon he was able to gain his trust. The emperor began to rely on the sorcerer for all of his needs, and the sorcerer began to manipulate the emperor’s mind

In essence, you're doing 'hosting', downloading the files from Github, hosting locally, running the program, and can submit the code on a platform like LeetCode or CodeForces.
So, where are you in your journey?
YOUR QUEST: Let's build a Calculator in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript that can perform some sort of math operations. Configure it as described below.
Create a Calculator page with an area where one or more regular buttons can be added.
Create the Buttons and their options you would want to make the Calculator responsive. Also create the buttons for Clearing the value inside the Calculator page and bringing about the mathematical calculation from the previous step.
At the end of the day, you will get as many points as the number of buttons pressed in a given sequence that it takes to calculate the correct solution. Catch Mistakes efficiently.
